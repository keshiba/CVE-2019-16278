![Rust](https://github.com/keshiba/cve-2019-16278/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)

This is an exploit for the CVE-2019-16278 vulnerability.

It allows remote code execution on an **nhttpd** server *v1.9.6*.

## Building from Source
This tool is written in Rust and you need to install the Rust compiler which is super easy if you follow the instructions in their [page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### Compiling
Once you have the compiler and `cargo` installed, you can run:
```bash
cargo build
```

## Example
```bash
./cve-2019-16278 10.10.1.1 80 "cat /etc/passwd"
```
This example connects to the host 10.10.1.1 on port 80 and executes the `cat /etc/passwd` on the remote host.
